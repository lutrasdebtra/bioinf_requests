Goal:
Scan genome for: NGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

Input:
FASTA file + strand 

The Fasta file will provide the + strand, the - strand will be created from the + strand and then reversed (to preserve antiparallel 5' -> 3' reading).

Actions:

If a set of bases == NGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN:
	extract all length 14 subsequences. E.g:
	NGGatgccgtaaagctagctacg

	extract:
	1. NGGatgccgtaaag
	2. GGatgccgtaaagc
	3. Gatgccgtaaagct
	4. atgccgtaaagcta
	5  tgccgtaaagctag
	6. gccgtaaagctagc
	7. ccgtaaagctagct
	8. cgtaaagctagcta
	9. gtaaagctagctac
	10 taaagctagctacg

Then scan + and - for matches to 14bp extractions,

Output:

3_mer	starting_base_in_geneome	Matching_14mer	Seq?	starting base matches	strand
NGGN20_sequence_1	10235				yes/no						750875			+/-

Changes to initial Spec:
	- Make starting base matches delimited to allow for multiple matches. 
	- Remove 'Seq?' field and just put sequence in '3mer' column:
	
	
Issues: The genome fasta file is linear, but the genome is circular, so scann has to 
take account of overlapping matches which start at the end of the file span the gap and 
finish at the start.
