== Bioinf Requests


Bioinf Requests is a system designed to allow users to submit requests. These requests are then taken up by admins, that complete the tasks submitted.

This is done with full email support, as well as an ldap login system.

The original purpose was to allow non-technical users to submit technical requests (along with any data required), and to recieve results back. Without ever having to talk to the technical department.
